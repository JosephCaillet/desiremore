Batch recursive converter of audio files, using ffmpeg powaaa!

desiremore development started when I needed a tool to convert audio files:
1. In batch (recursive conversion of every audio files inside a directory)
2. With preservation of the folder strucutre
3. With preservation of tags and covers
4. Without specifying a global conversion profile (use input file by input file caracteristics instead)

It turns out some software already existed to fulfill the first three requirements, but not nÂ°4. However, ffmpeg cli tool magnificently support number requirements nÂ°4, but not 1 to 3...

Couldn't we write something above it then? Well, desiremore is just that: a wrapper above ffmpeg to convert audio file in batch ! ðŸ˜Ž

**desiremore is in an early development phase (eg audio destination format is hardcoded), a more detailed readme and more file format support will come later.**

desriremore is made by Joseph Caillet and is released under GPL-3.0.<br>
